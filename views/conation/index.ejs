      <h1>What is Conation?</h1>
      <p class="lead">Conation strives to help business hit hardest by COVID-19.</p>
      <p>Small business owners are being heavily impacted by the current global pandemic. </p>
      <p>Often beloved, and very important to their local community; local businesses define a neighbourhood’s character and have close relationships with regular customers.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, staying in business is difficult for these local businesses, as they cannot operate as they usually do. Our application gives each community a way to support their favourite businesses so that they won’t be forced to close.</p>
